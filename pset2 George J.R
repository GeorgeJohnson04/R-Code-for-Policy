#mean of female leaders
mean(india$female)
#The output tells us about 33.54037% or 33.5% of the villages have female leaders

#mean of Irrigation
mean(india$irrigation)
#The output tells us that if we choose a random village we are likely to see 3.263975 new or repaired irrigation systems 
#however since irrigation systems have to be represented by a whole number we can assume if we choose a random village there will be 3 irrigation systems new / repaired
